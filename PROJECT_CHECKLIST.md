### Initial Data Setup
- [x] **Pokemon Card Data Import** (Major Progress 2025-06-30):
  1. **Comprehensive Import System** (Completed):
     ```bash
     npx tsx src/scripts/import-cards-simple.ts
     ```
     - Created full import script for all sets and cards
     - Initial import: 9 sets with 180 cards and 1,074 prices
     - **Current status: 2,408 cards imported (12.58% of 19,136 total)**
     - Fixed transformer issues (updatedAt reference error)
     - Added progress tracking and resume capability
     - Handles rate limiting (500ms between requests)
     - Import running in background (~168 cards/minute)
  
  2. **Smart Daily Import System** (Implemented):
     - Created priority-based import system
     - New sets (< 90 days): Daily updates
     - Recent sets (< 180 days): Every 3 days
     - Standard legal cards: Weekly updates
     - Expanded cards: Bi-weekly updates
     - Unlimited only: Monthly updates
     - **Does NOT import new cards - only updates existing ones**
  
  3. **Automated Import System** (Enhanced 2025-06-30):
     - Created auto-import.ts that intelligently chooses between:
       - Batch import when < 100% cards imported
       - Smart update when 100% cards imported
     - Created batch-import.ts for Vercel's 5-minute time limit
     - Processes 3 sets per run on Vercel, 10 locally
     - Runs daily at 5 AM UTC via Vercel Cron
     - Endpoint: `/api/cron/daily-import`
     - Protected by CRON_SECRET environment variable
     - **Total cards in Pokemon TCG API: 19,136**
     - **14 sets imported, 152 remaining**
  
  4. **Import Progress Tracking** (Created):
     ```bash
     npx tsx src/scripts/check-total-cards.ts
     ```
     - Shows current import progress vs API total
     - Displays completion percentage
     - Recommends next steps based on completion
  
  5. **Purchase Links** (Enhanced 2025-06-30):
     - All cards have TCGPlayer search URLs
     - **Improved URL format**: Combines "card name + set name" in query
     - **Fixed 2,200+ existing URLs** to use better search format
     - Direct TCGPlayer product URLs not available from Pokemon TCG API
     - Created documentation for future TCGPlayer API integration
     - Scripts created:
       - `fix-tcgplayer-search-urls.ts` - Updates existing URLs
       - `check-purchase-urls.ts` - Analyzes URL types
       - `check-sample-cards.ts` - Tests API responses
