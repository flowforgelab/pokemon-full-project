# Asynchronous AI Deck Analysis Implementation

## Overview
Implement an asynchronous analysis system to handle long-running GPT-4 analyses without timeout issues.

## Todo Items

### 1. Database Schema
- [x] Create Prisma schema for Analysis model
- [x] Add fields: id, deckId, userId, status, model, result, jobId, createdAt, completedAt
- [x] Run prisma db push to update database

### 2. Background Job Infrastructure
- [x] Create analysis job queue using Bull/BullMQ
- [x] Create job processor for AI analysis
- [x] Add job status tracking
- [x] Handle job failures and retries

### 3. API Endpoints
- [x] Modify POST /api/analysis/ai to create job instead of sync analysis
- [x] Create GET /api/analysis/ai/status/[jobId] for status checks
- [x] Create GET /api/analysis/ai/result/[jobId] for retrieving results
- [x] Add proper error handling for all endpoints

### 4. UI Components
- [x] Create AnalysisStatus component for progress display
- [x] Add polling mechanism to check job status
- [x] Create "Analysis in Progress" page
- [x] Update AI analysis client to handle async flow
- [ ] Add ability to navigate away and return

### 5. Result Storage & Retrieval
- [x] Store completed analyses in database
- [x] Create analysis history page
- [ ] Add caching for completed analyses
- [x] Allow viewing past analyses

### 6. User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add estimated completion time
- [ ] Show detailed progress steps
- [ ] Add option for email notifications (future)
- [ ] Create quick vs deep analysis options

## Implementation Notes
- Keep changes simple and focused
- Test each component independently
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Use existing Bull/BullMQ setup

## Review Summary

### Completed Tasks

1. **Database Schema** (✅ Complete)
   - Added Analysis model to Prisma schema with all required fields
   - Added AnalysisStatus enum for tracking job states
   - Updated User and Deck models with Analysis relationships
   - Successfully ran prisma db push

2. **Background Job Infrastructure** (✅ Complete)
   - Added aiAnalysisQueue to existing queue system
   - Created AIAnalysisProcessor class for handling jobs
   - Integrated with existing job processor system
   - Added retry configuration and error handling

3. **API Endpoints** (✅ Complete)
   - Modified POST /api/analysis/ai to create jobs instead of sync analysis
   - Created GET /api/analysis/ai/status/[jobId] for status checking
   - Created GET /api/analysis/ai/result/[jobId] for result retrieval
   - All endpoints include proper authentication and error handling

4. **UI Components** (✅ 80% Complete)
   - Created AnalysisStatus component with progress indicators
   - Implemented polling mechanism (2-second intervals)
   - Updated AIAnalysisClient to handle async flow
   - Shows real-time status updates during analysis
   - Missing: Ability to navigate away and return to analysis

5. **Result Storage & Retrieval** (✅ 75% Complete)
   - Analysis results stored in database
   - Created analysis history page at /analysis/history
   - Users can view past analyses and re-access results
   - Missing: Caching layer for performance

### Key Changes Made

1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - AI analysis now runs in background via Bull queue
   - No more timeout issues for GPT-4 models
   - Users see real-time progress updates

2. **Data Persistence**
   - All analyses saved to database
   - Includes metadata: model, focus areas, user age, timing
   - Failed analyses tracked with error messages

3. **User Experience**
   - Clean progress UI with status indicators
   - Analysis history for reviewing past results
   - Ability to filter and search analyses

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Queue System**: Leveraged existing Bull/BullMQ infrastructure
2. **Polling**: Client-side polling for simplicity (vs WebSockets)
3. **Database**: Direct storage of analysis results in JSON field
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking at all levels

### Next Steps

1. Add ability to resume in-progress analyses from any page
2. Implement Redis caching for completed analyses
3. Add estimated completion times based on model
4. Consider WebSocket integration for real-time updates
5. Add bulk analysis capabilities for multiple decks
