# Deck Analyzer Priority Comparison

## Original Priorities vs Improved Priorities

### ‚ùå Original Priorities (Too Specific)
1. Energy acceleration abilities
2. Prize trade math  
3. Evolution ratios with Rare Candy
4. Draw engine adequacy
5. Meta relevance

**Problems:**
- Focuses on specific mechanics before basics
- Misses fundamental deck issues
- Not applicable to all deck types
- No clear hierarchy of importance

### ‚úÖ Improved Priorities (Comprehensive)

#### Tier 1: Fundamental Playability üö®
**Must Pass All - Binary Checks**
1. **Basic Pokemon Count** - Can the deck start a game?
   - Need 8-12 basics minimum
   - Mulligan rate must be <15%
   
2. **Win Condition** - Can the deck actually win?
   - Clear primary attacker(s)
   - Sufficient damage output
   
3. **Format Legality** - Is the deck legal?
   - Rotation compliance
   - Card limit rules

#### Tier 2: Consistency Engine ‚öôÔ∏è
**Core Functionality - Scored 0-100**
4. **Complete Consistency Package**
   - Draw (supporters + abilities)
   - Search (balls + trainers)  
   - Deck thinning
   
5. **Energy System Balance**
   - Count matches costs
   - Type requirements
   - Acceleration if needed

#### Tier 3: Competitive Analysis üèÜ
**Advanced Metrics**
6. **Prize Trade Economics**
7. **Evolution/Setup Speed**
8. **Recovery Options**

#### Tier 4: Meta Optimization üéØ
**Context-Dependent**
9. **Matchup Analysis**
10. **Tech Card Choices**

## Why This Structure is Superior

### 1. Follows Natural Deck Building Process
```
Can it start? ‚Üí Can it function? ‚Üí Can it compete? ‚Üí Can it win tournaments?
```

### 2. Catches Critical Issues First
- Original: Might analyze energy acceleration in an illegal deck
- Improved: Checks legality before anything else

### 3. Universal Application
- Original: Evolution ratios don't apply to Basic-only decks
- Improved: Every deck needs basics, win conditions, and consistency

### 4. Clear Priority Hierarchy
- Original: All 5 items seem equally important
- Improved: Tier 1 must pass before Tier 2 matters

## Example Analysis Difference

### Deck: 4 Charizard ex, 0 Charmander, 56 Trainers

**Original Priorities Would Check:**
1. ‚ùì Energy acceleration - Not relevant yet
2. ‚úì Prize trade - 2 prizes per Charizard
3. ‚ùå Evolution ratio - Catches the issue
4. ‚úì Draw engine - Plenty of trainers
5. ‚ùì Meta relevance - Can't assess

**Score: 60/100** (Seems okay-ish)

**Improved Priorities Would Check:**
1. ‚ùå **FAIL** - 4 basics = 76% mulligan rate!
2. ‚ùå **FAIL** - Can't evolve Charizard without Charmander
3. ‚úì Legal card counts

**Score: 0/100** (Deck is unplayable - correct assessment!)

The improved priorities immediately catch that this deck literally cannot function, while the original might give it a passing grade.
